Here's a (mostly) exhaustive list of open source projects I've started or was/am actively involved in.

- [SVT-AV1-PSY](https://svt-av1-psy.com/), a fork of the SVT-AV1 encoder with a focus on perceptual quality
- [SVT-AV1](https://gitlab.com/AOMediaCodec/SVT-AV1/), the production encoder for the AV1 video codec
- [The Codec Wiki](https://wiki.x266.mov/), a public resource for digital compression knowledge
- [`metrics`](https://github.com/psy-ex/metrics), a video encoder benchmarking tool
- [Aviator](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/aviator), a GUI for encoding AV1 video with Opus audio
- [fssimu2](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/fssimu2), a fast SSIMULACRA2 implementation in Zig
- [qoi-enc-zig](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/qoi-enc-zig), a fast encoder for the QOI lossless image codec written in Zig
- [qoi-dec-zig](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/qoi-dec-zig), a fast decoder for the QOI lossless image codec written in Zig
- [This website](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/www)
- [An Analysis of Compression Technologies Used in the Delivery of Internet Video](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/An-Analysis-of-Compression-Technologies-Used-in-the-Delivery-of-Internet-Video), a research paper I authored under the mentorship of [Luc Trudeau](https://luctrudeau.github.io) alongside my university
- [photodetect2](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/photodetect2), an implementation of SVT-AV1-PSY's photographic image detection algorithm in Zig
- [gb82 image set](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/gb82-image-set), a public domain image dataset for developing image compression algorithms
- [svt-av1-psy-web](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/svt-av1-psy-web), SVT-AV1-PSY's official website
- [wavelet-bench](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/wavelet-bench), a lightweight benchmarking tool for wavelet-based video codecs as well as x264
- [rAV1ator CLI](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/rav1ator-cli), a CLI tool for chunked video encoding
- [rAV1ator](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/rAV1ator), a GUI like Aviator that used rav1e instead of SVT-AV1
- [sxpsnr](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/sxpsnr), a standalone interface for the XPSNR video quality metric
- [vac-enc](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/vac-enc), an audio encoding frontend for Opus with high-quality resampling
- [md-to-html](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/md-to-html), a simple Markdown to HTML converter in Zig with support for simple frontmatter
- [av1an-command-gen](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/av1an-command-gen), a script for generating Av1an encoding commands
- [bdr-ssimu2](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/bdr-ssimu2), a script for plotting SSIMULACRA2 BD-rate graphs on videos
- [aVVCator](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/aVVCator), a GUI for encoding VVC video (made for April Fools)
- [photodetect](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/photodetect), an older prototype of photodetect2
- [essim](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/essim), a fork of Meta's eSSIM metric that is easy to set up and compiles correctly
- [vt-enc](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/vt-enc), a Videotoolbox encoder for macOS
- [av1-tile-calc](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/av1-tile-calc), a script that computes the optimal number of tiles to use for your AV1 video
- [privacy-policy-summarizer](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/privacy-policy-summarizer), a web app to summarize privacy policies with LLMs
- [readability-calc](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/readability-calc), a script to compute text readability
- [mpv-build-vvc](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/mpv-build-vvc), a script to build non-free MPV with VVC support (before it was easily available in FFmpeg)
- [hwenc-ssimu2-plotter](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/hwenc-ssimu2-plotter), a script to compare hardware encoders with SSIMULACRA2
