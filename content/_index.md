**Hi, I'm Gianni.** I build video & image compression technology for a more beautiful Internet.

{{ line() }}

Some of what I have worked on includes:

- [**Iris-WebP**](https://halide.cx/iris/), the world's best WebP encoder
- [**Eve-AV1**](https://www.twoorioles.com/eve-av1) & [**Eve-VP9**](https://www.twoorioles.com/eve-vp9), commercial video encoders developed by Two Orioles
- [**SVT-AV1-PSY**](https://svt-av1-psy.com/), a fork of the SVT-AV1 encoder with a focus on perceptual quality
- [**The Codec Wiki**](https://wiki.x266.mov/), a public resource for digital compression knowledge

You can find more on [my GitHub](https://github.com/gianni-rosato). I also enjoy contributing to open-source projects, including [SVT-AV1](https://gitlab.com/AOMediaCodec/SVT-AV1/).
