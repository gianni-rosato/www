    <p>How tiny can very tiny banner images get?</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>My friend <a href="https://hayl.in/">Haylin</a> introduced me to
<a href="https://matdoes.dev/buttons">88x31 images</a> and I completely fell in love with
them. She told me that this weekend I should add some to my site, so I ended up
making a couple of custom ones and peering with friends on this site's home
page. Fun times.</p>
<p>However, there was a catch. It bothered me that these images were all PNGs and
(<em>shudders</em>) GIFs straight out of the 1990s &amp; early 2000s. I get that's the
aesthetic, but I don't think it is paramount that we stick with older formats.</p>
<p>I've been involved in the multimedia compression scene donating my time as an
AV1 framework and encoder developer for a bit now, and I'd consider myself to be
somewhat well-versed in digital multimedia and data compression. Recently in the
image compression space, I've been focused on
<a href="https://svt-av1-psy.com/avif/">making lossy AVIF performant on larger, mostly photographic images</a>
that you'd commonly find on the Web. The 88x31s are thus super far out of my
comfort zone, so I was excited to see what I could accomplish with
"off-the-shelf" tools in a day or two.</p>
<h2 id="level-1-png">Level 1: PNG</h2>
<p>The easiest question to ask ourselves here is <strong>"How can we make the existing
88x31s smaller without any compromises whatsoever?"</strong></p>
<p>The answer is simple: PNG optimization. PNG is (in my opinion) an extremely
bloated spec compared to formats like <a href="https://qoiformat.org/">QOI</a> that achieve
the same goals at much lower complexity. The benefit of this is that there is
usually a lot of room for improvement in any standard PNG bitstream you
encounter online.</p>
<p>I'm going to ignore animated GIFs and APNG's for now and just look as still
images - we can start with twelve 88x31s
(<a href="https://files.catbox.moe/mbzslh.tzst">archive</a>) pulled straight from
<a href="https://matdoes.dev/buttons">matdoes.dev/buttons</a>. We'll cover animations
later.</p>
<p>We have ourselves a combined dataset of GIFs and PNGs here.</p>

<p>We're weighing in at an average of 1411 bytes per image. That's not too bad, but
we can do better even with the most basic, low-effort PNG encoding.</p>
<p>Using <code>magick -quality 0</code> we can get some PNGs out of the static GIFs. Here's
the effect on the filesize:</p>

<p>Even low effort, completely unoptimized PNG beats GIF here on average. GIF
sucks, please don't use GIF.</p>
<p>Now let's see what happens if we use <code>ect -9 --mt-deflate -strip</code> on the PNGs:</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>It doesn't seem like a crazy difference, but considering how little flexibility
we have with such tiny images, it is pretty impressive that we're looking at the
same exact format and the same image data.</p>
<p>Let's take it a step further with <code>ect -9999 -strip</code>:</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>Look at that, a <em>teensy</em> bit more off. This is pretty much right up against the
ceiling of what PNG can do for us without lossy techniques like palette
compression.</p>
<h3 id="png-summary">PNG Summary</h3>
<p>TL;DR, convert your GIFs to PNGs and run them through
<code>ect -9 --mt-deflate -strip</code>. With images this tiny, it is super fast, and
you'll shave off some bits at zero cost to compatibility or fidelity. But what
if we want to go further?</p>
<h2 id="level-2-lossless-webp">Level 2: Lossless WebP</h2>
<p>I know WebP has a bit of a reputation on the Web as having been the format that
was shoved down our throats by Google and didn't really ever become a new
standard for anything. I've talked in the past about lossy WebP being barely
competitive with JPEG despite being far newer, but overall I can't say I dislike
WebP as much as the next person. There are some important things to consider
with WebP:</p>
<ul>
<li>WebP is mostly talked about as a lossy format, but it can be lossless.</li>
<li>WebP's lossless mode is really impressive, and consistently outperforms the
most optimized PNGs.</li>
<li>WebP's animation support is pretty complete, especially compared to the mess
that is GIF and the relatively obscure APNG. Discord recently supports
animated WebP by default.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm going to go in guns blazing with max-effort bruteforce WebP lossless via
<code>cwebp</code>. I have <a href="https://github.com/gianni-rosato/minify">a script</a> that tries
every encoding effort level from 0 to 9 and picks the smallest one, as effort 9
isn't always the smallest for some reason. Here's the result:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#000000;color:#ffffff;"><code><span style="color:#b4d3e2;">webp_l/5.webp: 670 bytes

</span></code></pre>
<h3 id="webp-summary">WebP Summary</h3>
<p>An additional meaningful improvement with a bare compatibility cost and <em>still</em>
no loss of fidelity whatsoever. This is the power of WebP's lossless mode. It's
almost as significant as the gap between PNG and GIF. WebP is <em>worth using</em> for
something like this. It is fair to have hesitation about adopting a slightly
less common format, but WebP is supported across all major browsers. If your
favorite app doesn't support WebP, it isn't WebP's fault at this point; it is a
royalty free format that has its merits, and shouldn't be bastardized an account
of its shaky introduction.</p>
<p>But what if you don't care <em>at all</em> about compatibility, and you just want the
smallest possible file size without fidelity loss?</p>
<h2 id="step-3-jpeg-xl">Step 3: JPEG XL</h2>
<p>JPEG XL is an incredibly cool format. I have plenty of additional JPEG XL
coverage on my blog, and sites like the
<a href="https://jpegxl.info/">community-run JPEG XL site</a> exist if you'd like more
information, but the TL;DR is that JPEG XL is pretty much great at everything.
It is a royalty-free, modern format that is designed to be the best of all
worlds, and it is a format that I am very excited about.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Google's Chromium team notoriously rejected JPEG XL from the
Chromium browser engine, so it is not supported in Chrome or any browser that
uses Chromium. This is a huge bummer. JPEG XL is supported in Safari and
throughout the Apple ecosystem, as well as in browsers like Waterfox and
Thorium, so it is fair game to use JPEG XL images on your site with an
appropriate fallback.</p>
<p>For our purposes, we're just going to look at JPEG XL's lossless compression
with <code>cjxl 0.11.0</code>. We'll be using the hidden super high effort mode via
<code>cjxl -d 0 -e 11 --allow_expert_options</code> to see how low we can go:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#000000;color:#ffffff;"><code><span style="color:#b4d3e2;">jxl_l/11.jxl: 417 bytes
</span><span style="color:#b4d3e2;">jxl_l/10.jxl: 2394 bytes

</span><span style="color:#b4d3e2;">Average size: 1231 bytes
</span></code></pre>
<p>...Hm. Not exactly what was promised.</p>
<p>The reality is that JPEG XL's lossless mode is best with larger images, and
images with &gt;8 BPC. Especially for HDR, JPEG XL significantly outperforms high
bit depth PNG, and WebP doesn't support &gt;8 BPC. For tiny images like this, it is
clearly not the best choice given what we're seeing here.</p>
<p>The one saving grace we have at our disposal with JPEG XL is the super useful
tools it makes available to us to do <em>slightly lossy</em> compression. We can do
this by lowering the bit depth the encoder uses, or allowing JPEG XL's modular
lossless compression to utilize a lossy palette. PNG and WebP are capable of
similar tricks as well (like PNG's palette compression mode and WebP's "near
lossless" compression), but JPEG XL does it better via cjxl in my opinion.</p>
<p>Through adding <code>--modular_lossy_palette --modular_palette_colors=0</code>:</p>

<p>This is our best result yet, albeit a lossy one. Visual inpection will allow you
determine if this is too lossy for you, in which case it may be best to stick
with WebP.</p>
<h3 id="jpeg-xl-summary">JPEG XL Summary</h3>
<p>Overall, JPEG XL results seem mixed at this scale, and we've been driven to
resorting to slightly lossy compression which isn't a great showing for the
codec. However, if you look closely, there are some images that are the smallest
with JPEG XL...</p>
<pre style="background-color:#000000;color:#ffffff;"><code><span style="color:#b4d3e2;">jxl_l/11.jxl: 417 bytes
</span><span style="color:#b4d3e2;">jxl_l/12.jxl: 279 bytes

</span><span style="color:#b4d3e2;">jxl_l/5.jxl: 590 bytes
</span></code></pre>
<p>Exactly half the pictures were smallest with cjxl. The reference library for
JPEG XL (called libjxl) is still pre-1.0, so maybe the bitstream has latent
expressivity in its modular lossless mode that we've yet to see realized. The
creators of the format have mentioned that peak bitstream expressivity has yet
to be reached with libjxl especially as it pertains to lossy encoding, so only
time will tell.</p>
<h2 id="mixing-codecs">Mixing Codecs</h2>
<p>By mixing our favorable results from WebP and JPEG XL, we minify our 88x31s to
the maximum degree:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#000000;color:#ffffff;"><code><span style="color:#b4d3e2;">mix/11.jxl: 417 bytes

<p>This gives us, with no fidelity loss, our smallest average size yet. This is a
great result, and it shows that inspecting your outputs with compression is
almost always worth doing.</p>
<h2 id="animation">Animation</h2>
<p>For animated images, we have three major options:</p>
<ul>
<li>GIF</li>
<li>APNG</li>
<li>Animated WebP</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll spare you the misery - Animated WebP is the best choice for animated
images. It's the smallest, and it's supported in all major browsers. GIF is
supported everywhere, but it's the largest.</p>
<p>APNG encoding with FFmpeg: <code>ffmpeg -y -i {} -plays 0 {.}.apng</code></p>
<p>Animated WebP encoding with FFmpeg:
<code>ffmpeg -y -i {} -pix_fmt bgra -c:v libwebp_anim -lossless 1 {.}.webp</code></p>
<p>Using <a href="https://upallnight.neocities.org/anibanner.gif">this image</a>:</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>I know single image comparisons are flawed, but I've done more than just this
one and the results are consistent. APNG can often make GIFs a bit smaller, but
WebP crushes it here. You can optimize APNG further, but there isn't (usually) a
compatibility benefit - animated WebP is the way to go.</p>
<h2 id="my-approach">My Approach</h2>
<p>The 88x31s on my homepage are a combination of a number of different coding
techniques. I prioritized getting the maximum fidelity out of JPEG XL, and used
lossless WebP as a fallback. My personal 88x31 is a lossy palette JPEG XL, while
the JPEG XL community button is a lossy VarDCT JPEG XL. I quantized the bit
depth more aggressively with some images at very little fidelity loss, and
others I was able to use full lossless. Doing each of your images individually
is a great way to get the best results, but can be time consuming.</p>
<p>Everything animated is animated WebP, as animated JPEG XL isn't supported on
Safari so the majority of people seeing my JPEG XL animations wouldn't see
anything but a still frame.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>My final thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>For lossless compression, <strong>WebP consistently outperformed PNG and GIF</strong>,
offering meaningful size reductions at a minimal compatibility tradeoff.</li>
<li><strong>JPEG XL showed mixed results at this small scale</strong> but was able to achieve
the smallest file sizes for about half the images using lossless mode. Its
slightly lossy palette mode produced the smallest average size overall, but it
is still lossy so you may want to use with caution.</li>
<li><strong>Using WebP for some images and JPEG XL for others yielded the best overall
lossless compression results.</strong></li>
<li><strong>For animated images, WebP is clearly superior to both GIF and APNG</strong> in
terms of file size while still being lossless (lossy WebP is quite good, too;
it is a video codec under the hood, after all).</li>
<li>Carefully evaluating each image individually with different codecs and
settings is the key to achieving the best results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even for tiny, simple images, modern compression techniques can yield meaningful
improvements over legacy formats. It's worth taking the time to experiment with
different codecs and settings to find the best balance of quality and file size
for your images. You can argue it isn't practical because the images are already
so tiny, and you'd probably be right, but this is more about doing it for sport.</p>
<p>So, mess around a bit and see what you can do - it was a lot of fun for me, and
as the "compression guy," I can't be caught dead using unoptimized images
anywhere :)</p>
